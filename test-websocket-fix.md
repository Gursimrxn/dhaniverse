# WebSocket Connection Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Connection Management**
- Added `isConnecting` flag to prevent duplicate connection attempts
- Improved connection state tracking and cleanup
- Increased connection timeout from 10s to 15s
- Better handling of intentional disconnects

### 2. **Rate Limiting Improvements**
- **Client-side**: Reduced update frequency from 10fps to 5fps (200ms interval)
- **Server-side**: Reduced max updates from 10/sec to 5/sec (200ms minimum)
- Added position change threshold check (only update if moved >2 pixels)
- Increased position threshold from 3 to 5 pixels

### 3. **Message Queue Optimization**
- Reduced message batch size from 10 to 3
- Reduced queue size from 100 to 50 messages
- Increased flush interval from 100ms to 150ms
- Reduced retry attempts to prevent spam

### 4. **Server-side Connection Cleanup**
- Improved authentication debouncing (2 seconds per connection)
- Reduced inactive connection timeout from 5min to 3min
- Faster cleanup interval (30s instead of 60s)
- Better zombie connection detection and cleanup

### 5. **Ping/Pong Optimization**
- Increased ping interval from 30s to 45s
- Only ping if no activity for 45s (instead of 30s)
- Better activity tracking

## Expected Results:
- Fewer "connection lost" messages
- More stable WebSocket connections
- Reduced server load from excessive updates
- Better handling of network interruptions
- Cleaner connection state management

## Testing:
1. Open multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Move players around rapidly
3. Check for connection stability
4. Monitor console for connection errors
5. Test network interruptions (disable/enable wifi)
