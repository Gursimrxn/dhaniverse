# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Web3 authentication into the existing game application, allowing users to sign in using any browser-based cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.). The Web3 authentication will work alongside the existing Google authentication system, providing users with multiple sign-in options. The system will handle wallet connection, signature verification, and user session management while maintaining compatibility with the current authentication flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my Web3 wallet to sign into the game, so that I can use my existing cryptocurrency wallet for authentication instead of creating separate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL display a "Connect Wallet" button alongside existing authentication options
2. WHEN a user clicks "Connect Wallet" THEN the system SHALL detect and display available browser wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
3. WHEN a user selects a wallet THEN the system SHALL initiate the wallet connection process
4. WHEN the wallet connection is successful THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to sign a message for authentication
5. WHEN the user signs the authentication message THEN the system SHALL verify the signature and create/retrieve the user account
6. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the game interface with an active session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember my wallet connection, so that I don't have to reconnect my wallet every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with Web3 THEN the system SHALL store the wallet address and session information securely
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect to the previously used wallet automatically
3. WHEN the wallet is still connected in the browser THEN the system SHALL restore the user session without requiring re-authentication
4. WHEN the wallet is disconnected or unavailable THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to reconnect or use alternative authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to disconnect my wallet and sign out, so that I can securely end my session and switch to a different wallet or authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated with Web3 THEN the system SHALL display a "Disconnect Wallet" option in the user interface
2. WHEN a user clicks "Disconnect Wallet" THEN the system SHALL terminate the wallet connection and clear the user session
3. WHEN the wallet is disconnected THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the sign-in page
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored wallet information and session data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle wallet switching gracefully, so that I can change wallets without encountering errors or losing my session unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches wallet accounts in their browser THEN the system SHALL detect the account change
2. WHEN an account change is detected THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate with the new account
3. WHEN a user switches to a different wallet provider THEN the system SHALL handle the transition smoothly
4. WHEN wallet switching occurs during an active session THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved game state where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Web3 authentication to integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication system, so that users can choose their preferred authentication method without affecting the application's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Web3 authentication is implemented THEN it SHALL coexist with the existing Google authentication system
2. WHEN a user authenticates via Web3 THEN they SHALL have access to the same game features as users authenticated via Google
3. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL handle both Web3 wallet addresses and Google account identifiers consistently
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the AuthContext to reflect the current authentication method and user information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when wallet connection fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallet connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear, user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a user's wallet is locked THEN the system SHALL prompt them to unlock their wallet
3. WHEN a required wallet extension is not installed THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for installation
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
5. WHEN signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL explain the issue and allow the user to retry authentication
