# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical WebSocket reliability issues in the Dhaniverse multiplayer game. Currently, players experience frequent connection errors, duplicate connections, unreliable real-time updates, and poor session management. The WebSocket connection should be established as the first priority when the game loads, ensuring smooth multiplayer functionality with reliable player synchronization and chat features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the WebSocket connection to be established immediately when I access /game, so that I can seamlessly join the multiplayer environment without connection delays or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player navigates to /game THEN the system SHALL initiate WebSocket connection before loading game assets
2. WHEN the WebSocket connection is being established THEN the system SHALL display a connection status indicator
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection fails during initial load THEN the system SHALL retry connection with exponential backoff up to 5 attempts
4. IF the WebSocket connection cannot be established after 5 attempts THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow offline play
5. WHEN the WebSocket connection is successfully established THEN the system SHALL proceed to load game assets and initialize multiplayer features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to avoid duplicate WebSocket connections, so that my game session remains stable and my actions are not duplicated or conflicted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection already exists for a user session THEN the system SHALL close the existing connection before creating a new one
2. WHEN multiple browser tabs are opened for the same user THEN the system SHALL maintain only one active WebSocket connection per user
3. WHEN a connection attempt is made while another is in progress THEN the system SHALL cancel the previous attempt and proceed with the new one
4. WHEN the system detects duplicate connections from the same IP/user THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve conflicts by keeping the most recent connection
5. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the previous WebSocket connection before establishing a new one

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want reliable real-time updates of other players' positions and actions, so that I can see accurate multiplayer interactions without delays or missing updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another player moves THEN the system SHALL update their position on my screen within 100ms
2. WHEN a player joins the game THEN the system SHALL immediately display them to all connected players
3. WHEN a player disconnects THEN the system SHALL remove them from all other players' screens within 2 seconds
4. WHEN network conditions cause message loss THEN the system SHALL implement message queuing and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN the WebSocket connection is temporarily unstable THEN the system SHALL buffer position updates and sync when connection is restored
6. WHEN multiple players are moving simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates without conflicts or rendering issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want robust connection recovery mechanisms, so that temporary network issues don't permanently disconnect me from the multiplayer session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to reconnect within 1 second
2. WHEN reconnection attempts fail THEN the system SHALL use exponential backoff with a maximum delay of 30 seconds
3. WHEN the connection is restored after a disconnect THEN the system SHALL resynchronize player state and position
4. WHEN reconnection fails after 10 attempts THEN the system SHALL offer manual reconnection options
5. WHEN the user manually triggers reconnection THEN the system SHALL reset the reconnection counter and attempt fresh connection
6. WHEN connection quality is poor THEN the system SHALL adjust update frequency to maintain stability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want proper session management, so that my multiplayer experience is consistent and my identity is maintained across connection events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect to the WebSocket THEN the system SHALL authenticate my session using existing JWT tokens
2. WHEN my session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication without losing game progress
3. WHEN I reconnect after a disconnect THEN the system SHALL restore my previous game state and position
4. WHEN multiple devices are used with the same account THEN the system SHALL handle session conflicts gracefully
5. WHEN I close the browser/tab THEN the system SHALL properly clean up my WebSocket connection and notify other players
6. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection and session restoration automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear connection status feedback, so that I understand the current state of my multiplayer connection and can take appropriate action if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket is connecting THEN the system SHALL display "Connecting..." status
2. WHEN the WebSocket is connected THEN the system SHALL display "Connected" status with player count
3. WHEN the WebSocket is disconnected THEN the system SHALL display "Disconnected - Reconnecting..." status
4. WHEN reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL display "Connection Failed" with retry options
5. WHEN connection quality is poor THEN the system SHALL display warning indicators
6. WHEN in offline mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that multiplayer features are unavailable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the chat system to work reliably with the WebSocket connection, so that I can communicate with other players without message loss or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a chat message THEN the system SHALL deliver it to all connected players within 500ms
2. WHEN the WebSocket connection is unstable THEN the system SHALL queue chat messages and send them when connection is restored
3. WHEN I receive a chat message THEN the system SHALL display it immediately with proper sender identification
4. WHEN the connection is lost while typing THEN the system SHALL preserve my message draft
5. WHEN reconnecting after a disconnect THEN the system SHALL not duplicate previously sent messages
6. WHEN the chat system fails THEN the system SHALL provide error feedback and retry mechanisms
