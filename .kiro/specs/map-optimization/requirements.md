# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a high-performance and secure map loading system for the Dhaniverse game. The current system loads a 100MB finalmap.png file which is publicly accessible and easily stolen. This optimization will introduce encrypted binary map encoding, chunk-based rendering, and secure map delivery to significantly reduce loading times, protect game assets, and improve memory usage through dynamic chunk loading based on player position.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to load much faster than the current 100MB file so that I can start playing without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the initial map loading time SHALL be reduced by at least 80% compared to loading the current 100MB finalmap.png
2. WHEN a player moves around the map THEN only the visible and nearby chunks SHALL be loaded into memory, reducing initial download to under 5MB
3. WHEN the game loads THEN the total memory usage for map data SHALL be reduced by at least 70% through chunk-based loading

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth gameplay without stuttering when moving to new areas so that my gaming experience is uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player moves to a new chunk boundary THEN the new chunk SHALL load seamlessly without frame drops
2. WHEN chunks are being loaded or unloaded THEN the game frame rate SHALL remain above 30 FPS
3. WHEN a player moves quickly across the map THEN chunks SHALL preload in the direction of movement to prevent loading delays

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the map data to be stored in an encrypted binary format so that file sizes are minimized, parsing is faster, and assets are protected from theft.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN map data is converted to encrypted binary format THEN the file size SHALL be at least 70% smaller than the current 100MB PNG file
2. WHEN the encrypted binary map is parsed THEN the parsing time SHALL be at least 80% faster than loading the current PNG
3. WHEN the binary format is used THEN it SHALL maintain all existing map functionality including collision detection, building positions, and NPC locations
4. WHEN the map files are accessed directly THEN they SHALL be encrypted and unreadable without the game client

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility with existing map tools so that the development workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL support both JSON and binary map formats during development
2. WHEN a JSON map is provided THEN the system SHALL automatically convert it to binary format for production use
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide tools to convert binary maps back to readable JSON format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the collision detection to work seamlessly with the new chunk system so that gameplay mechanics remain intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collision detection is performed THEN it SHALL work correctly across chunk boundaries
2. WHEN a player interacts with buildings or NPCs THEN the interactions SHALL function identically to the current system
3. WHEN chunks are loaded or unloaded THEN collision objects SHALL be properly managed without memory leaks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game owner, I want the map assets to be protected from theft so that the game's intellectual property is secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN map files are served THEN they SHALL be encrypted with a client-specific key
2. WHEN someone tries to access map files directly THEN they SHALL not be able to extract readable map data
3. WHEN the game client requests map chunks THEN the server SHALL authenticate the request before serving encrypted data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms so that the game remains stable even if chunk loading fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chunk fails to load THEN the system SHALL retry loading with exponential backoff
2. WHEN multiple chunk loading failures occur THEN the system SHALL fall back to loading essential chunks only
3. WHEN network issues prevent chunk loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate user feedback and continue with available chunks
4. WHEN decryption fails THEN the system SHALL request a new encryption key from the server
