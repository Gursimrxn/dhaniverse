# Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for the Dhaniverse project, including Git workflow, branching strategy, code review process, and collaboration guidelines. The workflow is designed to maintain code quality, enable parallel development, and ensure smooth integration of features.

## Git Workflow

### Repository Structure

The Dhaniverse project follows a monorepo structure with the following main components:

- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript application (`src/`)
- **ICP Canister**: Rust backend (`packages/icp-canister/`)
- **Game Server**: Deno/TypeScript server (`server/game/`)
- **WebSocket Server**: Deno/TypeScript server (`server/ws/`)
- **Map Optimizer**: TypeScript utility package (`packages/map-optimizer/`)

### Branching Strategy

We use a Git Flow-inspired branching model with the following branch types:

#### Main Branches

- **`main`**: Production-ready code
  - Always deployable
  - Protected branch requiring pull request reviews
  - Automatic deployment to production environment

- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
  - Latest development changes
  - Base branch for feature branches
  - Continuous integration testing

#### Supporting Branches

- **Feature branches**: `feature/[issue-number]-[short-description]`
  - Created from `develop`
  - Merged back to `develop` via pull request
  - Example: `feature/123-wallet-integration`

- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/[issue-number]-[short-description]`
  - Created from `main` for critical production fixes
  - Merged to both `main` and `develop`
  - Example: `hotfix/456-security-patch`

- **Release branches**: `release/[version]`
  - Created from `develop` when preparing for release
  - Only bug fixes and release preparation commits
  - Merged to `main` and tagged with version

### Commit Message Convention

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **test**: Adding or modifying tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

#### Examples

```
feat(wallet): add MetaMask connection support

Implement MetaMask wallet connector with error handling
and connection state management.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(canister): resolve authentication token validation

- Fix JWT token expiration check
- Add proper error handling for invalid tokens
- Update tests for edge cases

Fixes #456
```

## Code Review Process

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required tools installed as documented in `docs/setup/prerequisites.md`.

### Local Development Workflow

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dhaniverse
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/123-new-feature
   ```

3. **Development Cycle**
   ```bash
   # Start development servers
   npm run dev          # Frontend development server
   npm run server:game  # Game server with hot reload
   npm run server:ws    # WebSocket server with hot reload
   
   # For ICP canister development
   cd packages/icp-canister
   dfx start --background
   dfx deploy --local
   ```

4. **Testing and Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   npm test
   cd packages/icp-canister && cargo test
   
   # Code quality checks
   npm run lint
   npm run format
   ```

5. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
   git push origin feature/123-new-feature
   ```

6. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use GitHub/GitLab interface
   - Fill out pull request template
   - Request reviews from team members

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Communication

- **Daily Standups**: Brief status updates and blockers
- **Code Reviews**: Constructive feedback and knowledge sharing
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated with code changes
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub/GitLab issues for bug reports and feature requests

### Conflict Resolution

#### Merge Conflicts

1. **Prevention**: Regularly sync with `develop` branch
2. **Resolution**: 
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout feature/your-branch
   git rebase develop
   # Resolve conflicts in editor
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   ```

#### Code Conflicts

- Discuss disagreements in pull request comments
- Escalate to team lead if consensus cannot be reached
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability

### Best Practices

#### General

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
- Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Remove dead code and unused imports

#### Git Practices

- Make atomic commits with single logical changes
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Use interactive rebase to clean up commit history before merging
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

#### Code Organization

- Follow established project structure
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns between components, services, and utilities
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Implement proper error handling and logging

- All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Code coverage meets minimum threshold (80%)
- No linting errors or warnings
- Security scan passes
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable range
- Documentation updated for public API changes

## Release Process

### Version Management

Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Steps

1. **Prepare Release Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b release/1.2.0
   ```

2. **Update Version Numbers**
   - Update `package.json` version
   - Update `Cargo.toml` version
   - Update documentation versions

3. **Final Testing**
   - Run full test suite
   - Manual testing of critical paths
   - Performance testing

4. **Create Release**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge release/1.2.0
   git tag v1.2.0
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

5. **Post-Release**
   - Merge release branch back to develop
   - Deploy to production
   - Update changelog
   - Announce release

This workflow ensures code quality, enables efficient collaboration, and maintains a stable production environment while allowing for rapid development and iteration.
